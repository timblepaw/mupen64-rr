This is the project page for the rerecording branch of Mupen64.  The primary purpose of this project is to provide and expand features related to creating [http:/tasvideos.org Tool-Assisted] movies.

It is hoped that [Mupen64Plus](http://code.google.com/p/mupen64plus/) will one day be accepted by TASVideos and obsolete Mupen64.
